## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Mechatronics Engineering student at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz** with a strong passion for both **hardware and software development**.

Before university, I completed a **Higher Technical College (HTL) degree in Mechanical Engineering** with a focus on **Automation Technology**, where I gained hands-on experience with **industrial systems and control engineering**.

I enjoy working with **PLCs (SPS), microcontrollers, and embedded systems**, and I like building complete solutions — from hardware design to software implementation.
