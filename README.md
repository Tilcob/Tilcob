## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Mechatronics Engineering student at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz** with a strong interest in **automation, embedded systems, and software development**.

Before university, I graduated from a **Higher Technical College (HTL) in Mechanical Engineering**, specializing in **Automation Technology**, where I gained hands-on experience with industrial systems.

I enjoy working on projects that combine **hardware and software**, especially involving **PLCs, microcontrollers, sensors, and networked systems**.

### 🏭 Conveyor Belt Automation with Scanners & Microcontroller

- Modified an existing **conveyor belt system**
- Installed **two scanners**:
  - Side scanner: reads **carton codes**
  - Top scanner: reads **bottle codes**
- A **microcontroller** processes scanner signals and counts detected codes
- System verifies whether the **expected number of bottle codes** is present
- If the count is incorrect:
  - Conveyor continues until an **internal µC timer expires**
  - Conveyor belt then **stops automatically**
- Focus on **reliability, timing logic, and signal processing**

**Technologies:** Microcontroller, digital I/O, scanners, timers, automation logic
