## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Mechatronics Engineering student at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) Linz** with a strong interest in **automation, embedded systems, and software development**.

Before university, I graduated from a **Higher Technical College (HTL) in Mechanical Engineering**, specializing in **Automation Technology**, where I gained hands-on experience with industrial systems.

I enjoy building complete systems that combine **hardware and software**, especially involving **PLCs, microcontrollers, sensors, and networked applications**.
